论文以密云水库上游流域为研究对象，分析人类活动影响下海河流域典型山区的水循环变化特征。分析表明在1956005年期间，流域年径流明显减少，降雨和平均气温分别呈显著下降和升高趋势，人工取水量明显增加，人类活动和气候变化是引起径流减少的主要原因。论文将研究期划分为1956983和1984005年两个时段，以两时段内年平均径流的变化来评价流域径流的减少量，并采用数据分析与水文模型相结合的综合分析方法，定量评价了人工取用水、气候变化以及下垫面变化对径流减少的贡献。结果表明，人类活动对径流减少的贡献略小于气候变化的贡献。 论文以位山引黄灌区为研究对象，探讨人类活动影响下海河流域典型平原灌区的水循环变化特征。对1974007年位山灌区地下水位变化的分析表明，灌区地下水位总体保持在较高水平，但一干渠末端附近的地下水位出现较明显的下降。灌区地下水位在空间分布上沿干渠上游至下游逐渐下降，灌区内地下水位高于灌区外，表明引黄灌溉是维持位山灌区现状地下水位的主要原因。在位山灌区典型田间的水循环综合观测数据基础上，结合田间水循环模型，分析了农田水分运移规律及水量平衡特征。在黄河水资源供需矛盾日益突出的背景下，位山灌区未来引黄水量可能有所减少，论文以1984007年的气象和引黄流量数据为基础，采用田间水循环模型分析了不同灌溉水平下，灌区地下水位及蒸散发的变化特征。 对于位山灌区，人类活动对水环境也有明显影响。灌溉导致地下水位抬升，带来土壤盐渍化风险;灌溉和施肥影响农田的氮素平衡，硝态氮淋溶可能造成地下水污染。论文在2010年51月期间，对灌区典型农田的土壤水与地下水进行了分层连续采样，检测了样本的盐分与氮素含量，检测数据显示：土壤水与地下水中，盐分浓度在120cm附近出现峰值，硝态氮浓度总体随埋深的增加而降低;铵态氮含量很低，表明土壤的硝化能力很强。论文采用田间盐分运移模型，探讨了灌排不平衡时的盐渍化风险;建立了对饱和－非饱和带耦合模拟的农田氮素迁移转化模型，探讨了农田氮素平衡特征，并对根层硝态氮的淋溶损失进行了评估。","extra":"CLC:

To perform these separations efficiently at scale, new materials are needed with greater efficiencies in the capture and release of CO2 from the emissions of fossil fuel-fired power plants and industrial process streams. In recent years, metal–organic frameworks, constructed from inorganic ions or clusters connected by organic bridging units, have shown particular promise in improving the efficiency of CO2 separations. Specifically, a new class of metal–organic frameworks of the form M2(dobpdc)(diamine)2 (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Zn; dobpdc4− = 4,4′-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3′-dicarboxylate) have been found to capture CO2 through a cooperative mechanism involving the switch-like, reversible polymerization of CO2 in ammonium carbamate chains along the pore axis. Chapter 1 introduces the concept of carbon capture and sequestration, beginning with an overview of common adsorbent classes employed for CO2 capture applications. Opportunities and challenges are subsequently discussed for CO2 removal from individual potential target streams, including the flue emissions of power plants, industrial process streams, and air. Specific reports are selected to highlight recent advances in overcoming stream-specific challenges, such as stability to common adsorbent poisons. The chapter concludes with a discussion of key needs from the materials research community to accelerate greater adoption of carbon capture technologies. Chapter 2 describes the development of alkylethylenediamine-appended variants of Mg2(dobpdc) for carbon capture applications. Small modifications to the diamine structure are shown to shift the threshold pressure for cooperative CO2 adsorption by over 4 orders of magnitude at a given temperature. The observed trends are rationalized on the basis of crystal structures of the isostructural zinc frameworks obtained by in situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. The structure–activity relationships derived from these results are subsequently shown to enable the optimization of adsorbent design to match the conditions of a given CO2 separation process, thereby minimizing the energetic cost of CO2 capture. Chapter 3 leverages the results of Chapter 2 in the design of a diamine-appended framework for cooperative CO2 capture from the flue emissions of natural gas combined cycle power plants. Due to growing adoption of natural gas as a fuel source, the emissions of gas-fired plants are contributing a growing portion of global CO2 emissions, but CO2 capture from these power plants is hindered by the low CO2 concentration and high oxygen and water content of the flue stream. In this chapter, functionalization of Mg2(dobpdc) with the cyclic diamine 2-(aminomethyl)piperidine (2-ampd) is shown to produce an adsorbent that is capable of >90% CO2 capture from a humid natural gas flue emission stream, as confirmed by breakthrough measurements. Multicomponent adsorption experiments, infrared spectroscopy, magic angle spinning solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and van der Waals-corrected density functional theory studies suggest that water enhances CO2 capture in 2-ampd–Mg2(dobpdc) through hydrogen-bonding interactions with the carbamate groups of the ammonium carbamate chains formed upon CO2 adsorption, thereby increasing the thermodynamic driving force for CO2 binding. The exceptional thermal, oxidative, and cycling stability of this material are subsequently demonstrated, indicating that 2-ampd–Mg2(dobpdc) is a promising adsorbent for this important separation. Chapter 4 describes the development of a diamine-appended framework for CO2 removal from crude natural gas. Due to its low CO2 emission intensity compared to coal, natural gas is favored as a cleaner-burning fuel. However, for many natural gas reserves, CO2 contamination must be removed at the wellhead to meet pipeline specifications. In this chapter, the framework ee-2–Mg2(dobpdc) (ee-2 = N,N-diethylethylenediamine) is demonstrated as a next-generation CO2 capture material for high-pressure natural gas purification. This material can be readily regenerated with a minimal change in temperature or pressure and maintains its CO2 capacity in the presence of water. Moreover, consistent with the results in Chapter 3, breakthrough experiments reveal that water enhances the CO2 capture performance of ee-2–Mg2(dobpdc) by reducing or eliminating “slip” of CO2 prior to full breakthrough. As in Chapter 3, spectroscopic characterization and multicomponent isobars suggest that the enhanced performance under humid conditions arises from preferential stabilization of the CO2-inserted phase in the presence of water. The favorable performance of ee-2–Mg2(dobpdc) is further demonstrated through comparison with a benchmark material for this separation, zeolite 13X, as well as through extended pressure cycling experiments. Finally, Chapter 5 builds upon the previous chapters in this work to advance a diamine-appended framework toward commercialization in upgrading crude biogas to biomethane, a renewable natural gas equivalent. Using the principles outlined in previous chapters, the material dmpn–Mg2(dobpdc) (dmpn = 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-diaminopropane) is identified as a promising candidate for this separation, and its performance in capturing CO2 from CO2/CH4 mixtures is first demonstrated at the laboratory scale. Through a collaboration with Mosaic Materials, a start-up company working to commercialize cooperative adsorbents for CO2 separations, the performance of dmpn–Mg2(dobpdc) is then demonstrated in breakthrough experiments with composite pellets at the 30–50 g scale. Importantly, these experiments enable simultaneous monitoring of heat and mass transfer in the adsorbent bed, resulting in data suitable to inform the development of a process model. Finally, in partnership with the Davis Wastewater Treatment Plant, slipstream tests are conducted with a crude biogas stream containing water, oxygen, H2S, and siloxanes. These early results suggest that dmpn–Mg2(dobpdc) is relatively robust to H2S and can withstand short-term exposure to crude biogas feeds, representative of a process failure in upstream pretreatment units. These results represent a promising step toward the commercialization of cooperative adsorbents for CO2 separations.","language":"en-US","libraryCatalog":"CQVIP","thesisType":"博士学位论文","university":"University of California, Berkeley","url":"https://wwwv3.cqvip.com/doc/degree/3334769152","attachments":[],"tags":[{"tag":"Ammonium carbamate chains"},{"tag":"Carbon dioxide separations"},{"tag":"Greenhouse gas emissions"}],"notes":[]}]},{"type":"web","url":"https://www.cqvip.com/search?k=%E7%8E%B0%E4%BB%A3%E6%B1%89%E8%AF%AD","items":"multiple"},{"type":"web","url":"https://www.cqvip.com/advancesearch","items":"multiple"},{"type":"web","url":"https://www.cqvip.com/journal/1022577/column","items":"multiple"},{"type":"web","url":"https://www.cqvip.com/qk/90024x/2002s1/1000445202.html","items":[{"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"柑橘类胡萝卜素合成关键基因研究进展","creators":[{"lastName":"徐昌杰","firstName":"","creatorType":"author","fieldMode":1},{"lastName":"张上隆","firstName":"","creatorType":"author","fieldMode":1}],"date":"2002","ISSN":"0513-353X","abstractNote":"类胡萝卜素是柑橘成熟果实的主要色素 ,其含量和组成影响果实外观及营养价值。柑橘类胡萝卜素合成及调控研究已开始深入到分子水平 ,本研究小组现已成功分离柑橘类胡萝卜素合成主链上的所有 9个基因 (同源基因 )。介绍作者分离这些基因的过程和国内外对这些基因特性研究的最新进展 ,并展望今后研究的热点和趋势。","extra":"citation: 18\\nCLC: Q943 [植物细胞遗传学]","issue":"S1","language":"zh-CN","libraryCatalog":"CQVIP","pages":"619-623","publicationTitle":"园艺学报","url":"https://wwwv3.cqvip.com/doc/journal/987138118","volume":"29","attachments":[],"tags":[{"tag":"合成"},{"tag":"基因"},{"tag":"柑橘"},{"tag":"类胡萝卜素"}],"notes":[]}]}],"zhLabel":"维普网","trends":[{"author":"jiaojiaodubai","date":"2024-09-19 15:11:09 +0800","message":"忽略url大小写"},{"author":"jiaojiaodubai","date":"2024-09-13 12:12:19 +0800","message":"适配journalArticle的新案例"},{"author":"jiaojiaodubai","date":"2024-08-21 15:10:38 +0800","message":"WeiPu -> CQVIP Qikan; CQVIP -> CQVIP Knowledge; add CQVIP"}],"fileName":"CQVIP.js"}},"relativePath":"translators/17364f55-b899-4553-977c-c1b062e80d28.md","filePath":"translators/[translatorID].md"}'),s={name:"translators/17364f55-b899-4553-977c-c1b062e80d28.md"},y=Object.assign(s,{setup(n){return(c,e)=>(o(),r("div",null,[e[0]||(e[0]=t("p",null,[t("a",{href:"./"},"返回转换器列表")],-1)),i(a)]))}});export{b as __pageData,y as default};
