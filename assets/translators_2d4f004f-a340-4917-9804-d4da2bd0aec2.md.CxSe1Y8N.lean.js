The target user group is musicians who primarily use audio and text for composition and arrangement, rather than with formal music notation. Using the principle of user-centered design, the software implementation was guided by a diary study involving nine musicians which suggested five requirements for the software to support: capturing, overdubbing, developing, storing, and organizing. Moreover, the underlying spatial data-model was exploited to give raw audio compositions a hierarchical structure, and-to aid musicians in retrieving previous ideas-a search facility is available to support both query by humming and text-based queries. A user evaluation of the completed design with eleven subjects indicated that musicians, in general, would find the hypermedia environment useful for capturing and managing their moments of musical creativity and exploration. More specifically they would make use of the query by humming facility and the hierarchical track organization, but not the overdubbing facility as implemented.","conferenceName":"10th annual joint conference on digital libraries 2010","extra":"CLC: 电子图书馆、数字图书馆;","language":"en-US","libraryCatalog":"掌桥科研","proceedingsTitle":"-","url":"https://www.zhangqiaokeyan.com/academic-conference-foreign_10th-annual-joint-conference-digital-libraries-2010_thesis/020511310215.html","attachments":[{"title":"Snapshot","mimeType":"text/html"}],"tags":[{"tag":"music composition"},{"tag":"personal digital music library"},{"tag":"spatial hypermedia"}],"notes":[]}]},{"type":"web","url":"https://www.zhangqiaokeyan.com/academic-degree-domestic_mphd_thesis/02031271925.html","items":[{"itemType":"thesis","title":"农村电商、农民创业与农民收入增长研究","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"张秀","creatorType":"author","fieldMode":1},{"firstName":"","lastName":"闫星宇","creatorType":"contributor","fieldMode":1}],"date":"2018","extra":"major: 产业经济学\\nCLC: 中国农业经济;","language":"zh-CN","libraryCatalog":"掌桥科研","thesisType":"硕士学位论文","university":"南京财经大学","url":"https://www.zhangqiaokeyan.com/academic-degree-domestic_mphd_thesis/02031271925.html","attachments":[{"title":"Snapshot","mimeType":"text/html"}],"tags":[{"tag":"农村"},{"tag":"农民创业"}],"notes":[]}]},{"type":"web","url":"https://www.zhangqiaokeyan.com/academic-degree-domestic_mphd_thesis/020316460411.html","items":[{"itemType":"thesis","title":"关系理性视域下马克思恩格斯生态思想研究","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"宋玉兰","creatorType":"author","fieldMode":1},{"firstName":"","lastName":"李桂花","creatorType":"contributor","fieldMode":1}],"date":"2020","extra":"major: 马克思主义基本原理\\nCLC: 企业经济;","language":"zh-CN","libraryCatalog":"掌桥科研","thesisType":"博士学位论文","university":"吉林大学","url":"https://www.zhangqiaokeyan.com/academic-degree-domestic_mphd_thesis/020316460411.html","attachments":[{"title":"Snapshot","mimeType":"text/html"}],"tags":[],"notes":[]}]},{"type":"web","url":"https://www.zhangqiaokeyan.com/academic-degree-foreign_mphd_thesis/0206149254.html","items":[{"itemType":"thesis","title":"Using decision and risk analysis to assist in policy making about terrorism.","creators":[{"firstName":"Rosoff, Heather","lastName":"Beth","creatorType":"author"}],"date":"2009","abstractNote":"Risk has been characterized as a function of a potential threat, vulnerability to the threat, and the consequences were the threat to be carried out. In the context of terrorism, threats are the individuals who might wage an attack against a specific target; vulnerabilities are the people and targets whose safety is contingent upon the effectiveness of security policies; and consequences are the possible negative outcomes from an attack. The intent of this paper is to use different risk and decision analysis techniques to assist in the policy making relative to assessing these three different components that define terrorism risk.;First, a methodology is described for representing terrorist leader preferences for alternative attack strategies against the U.S. A multi-attribute utility model embedded within a Risk simulation model was developed to characterize terrorist motivations and values. Ultimately, relative likelihood of a terrorist attack is determined as a function of the terrorists' attack utility. While the model's outputs are mostly illustrative of the methodology used, the policy implications of the approach are considered.;Next, the threat of attacks on the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach is analyzed.  Terrorists are assumed to be using a radiological dispersal device (RDD, also known as a \\"dirty bomb\\") to shut down port operations and cause substantial economic and psychological impacts. The analysis is an exploratory investigation of a combination of several risk analysis tools, including scenario generation and pruning, project risk analysis, direct consequence modeling, and indirect economic impact assessment. The implications for countering a dirty bomb, including the protection of the radiological sources and intercepting an ongoing dirty bomb attack, are discussed.;Lastly, a compilation of three studies were conducted to assess how individuals perceive the risks of terrorism. The psychometric paradigm is employed to evaluate the influence of various predictor variables, both cognitive and emotional, on this calculation. Results describing the findings' policy implications on preparedness and response efforts, such as what efforts are needed to keep people educated about terrorism and how that information should be directed, are included.","extra":"major: Political Science Public Administration.\\nCLC: 政治理论;","language":"en-US","libraryCatalog":"掌桥科研","numPages":"191","thesisType":"Doctoral dissertation","university":"University of Southern California.","url":"https://www.zhangqiaokeyan.com/academic-degree-foreign_mphd_thesis/0206149254.html","attachments":[{"title":"Snapshot","mimeType":"text/html"}],"tags":[],"notes":[]}]},{"type":"web","url":"https://www.zhangqiaokeyan.com/academic-degree-foreign_mphd_thesis/0206172122.html","items":[{"itemType":"thesis","title":"Design of an optical phantom for calibration of small animal fluorescence imagers.","creators":[{"firstName":"Ghadiyaram, Ravi Krishna","lastName":"Chaitanya","creatorType":"author"}],"date":"2009","abstractNote":"Small animal imaging is similar to fluorescence microscopy, which is an interesting and advancing technology in the clinical field to understand the cell structures, behavior, and functions inside a body. These studies have a limitation of the standard calibration techniques of the optical devices. Tissue phantoms are used to calibrate optical devices. These phantoms allow one to relate optical measurements of real tissue to established quantitative standards. Researchers working in this field have calibrated the phantom actively or passively. Previously there were no standard calibration techniques for small animal fluorescence imagers that were being proposed.;In this work, results are proposed in developing a tissue phantom which combines both active and passive components in a single phantom that are used to calibrate the imager, camera and the system as a whole for an optical device. Various plastics are selected based on their color resemblance to tissues. Studies of absorption, reflection and fluorescence properties of these plastics are estimated using the spectrometer assembly. LED's are equipped at the back of the phantom with a variable amount of voltage passing through them to calibrate the camera and system as a whole.","extra":"major: Engineering Biomedical.;Engineering Chemical.\\nCLC: 药物化学;","language":"en-US","libraryCatalog":"掌桥科研","numPages":"82","thesisType":"Master's thesis","university":"University of South Alabama.","url":"https://www.zhangqiaokeyan.com/academic-degree-foreign_mphd_thesis/0206172122.html","attachments":[{"title":"Snapshot","mimeType":"text/html"}],"tags":[],"notes":[]}]},{"type":"web","url":"https://www.zhangqiaokeyan.com/patent-detail/06120112145532.html","items":[{"itemType":"patent","title":"治疗脑内出血的组合物和方法","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"S·阿金","creatorType":"inventor","fieldMode":1},{"firstName":"","lastName":"J·弗鲁比斯","creatorType":"inventor","fieldMode":1},{"firstName":"","lastName":"M·E·卡尔","creatorType":"inventor","fieldMode":1},{"firstName":"","lastName":"S·赫特","creatorType":"inventor","fieldMode":1},{"firstName":"","lastName":"R·贾舒亚","creatorType":"inventor","fieldMode":1},{"firstName":"","lastName":"D·D·彼德曼","creatorType":"inventor","fieldMode":1}],"issueDate":"2021-01-01","abstractNote":"本公开提供了通过施用FXa变体治疗或预防对象脑内出血(ICH)的组合物和方法。","applicationNumber":"CN202011260045.4","assignee":"辉瑞公司","country":"中国","extra":"Genre: 发明专利","filingDate":"2015-01-15","patentNumber":"CN112156176A","place":"中国","url":"https://www.zhangqiaokeyan.com/patent-detail/06120112145532.html","attachments":[{"title":"Snapshot","mimeType":"text/html"}],"tags":[],"notes":[]}]},{"type":"web","url":"https://www.zhangqiaokeyan.com/patent-detail/06130400000018.html","items":[{"itemType":"patent","title":"Rotor for a brushless DC motor","creators":[{"firstName":"Arthur-Richard","lastName":"Matyas","creatorType":"inventor"},{"firstName":"Eugen","lastName":"Kombowski","creatorType":"inventor"},{"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"inventor"}],"issueDate":"2020-05-14","abstractNote":"Rotor (1) für einen bürstenlosen Gleichstrommotor (2), zumindest aufweisend:- eine Mehrzahl von Rotorsegmente (3) zur Realisierung eines Magnetkreises, wobei die Rotorsegmente (3) ringförmig um eine Drehachse (4) des Rotors (1) angeordnet sind;- eine Mehrzahl von Rotormagnete (5), die zwischen den Rotorsegmenten (3) angeordnet sind; und- einen Rotorträger (6), der aus einem Blech (7) geformt ist und an einer Umfangsfläche (8) eine Mehrzahl von Haltelaschen (9) aufweist, mit denen die Rotorsegmente (3) an dem Rotorträger (6) befestigt sind.","applicationNumber":"DE102018128369","assignee":"Schaeffler Technologies AG & Co.
