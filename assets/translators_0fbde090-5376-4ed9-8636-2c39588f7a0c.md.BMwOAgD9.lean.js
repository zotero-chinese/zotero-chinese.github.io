For an increasing number of applications, mainly related to material inspection and research, automation through optical sensing, particle physics, biology, or medicine, one of the main goals that photodetector technology has been striving for over the last decades is the ability to detect single photons over a variety of photon wavelengths, measuring their exact time of arrival to the detectors' active area and reconstructing their accurate spatial path. In other words, the \\"holy grail\\" of photodetection became offering the ability to measure as many characteristics as possible of a single photon in absence of other quanta of radiation. This proved to be a quite difficult task.","bookTitle":"Photodetectors","extra":"CLC: 红外探测、红外探测器","language":"en-US","libraryCatalog":"国家科技图书文献中心","pages":"37-72","url":"https://www.nstl.gov.cn/paper_detail.html?id=548dca9c1908bbe3e6df0ba4490c94f2","attachments":[],"tags":[{"tag":"avalanche diode"},{"tag":"other quanta"},{"tag":"photodetection became"}],"notes":[]}]},{"type":"web","url":"https://www.nstl.gov.cn/paper_detail.html?id=8232bdce6ef1c515e701e5c8333980b5","items":[{"itemType":"thesis","title":"跨文化交际中的文化身份","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"温福兰","creatorType":"author","fieldMode":1},{"firstName":"","lastName":"肖华锋","creatorType":"contributor","fieldMode":1}],"date":"2005-09-01","abstractNote":"Chapter One.Introduction  1.1.The Significance of the Thesis\\n    Cultural identity is important in intercultural communication，because a   person's cultural identity exerts a profound influence on his or her communicative   style and there are cultural differences in the structures of expectation to identity.  When people from different ethnic or cultural background come in contact，cultural   differences and historical and economical disparity between these cultural or social   groups Can easily lead to stereotyping，prejudice，discrimination，ethnocentrism，  which are serious pronems to effective intercultural communication. Sometimes   cultural conflicts occur.among which identity conflict is one of those intractable   conflicts.So，it is important for people to appreciate what constitutes membership in   the cultures and how that membership might influence the manner in which people   approach，perceive，and interact with other cultures.  1.2.The Purpose of the Thesis\\n    This thesis is the study of cultural identity of sonic minority or marginalized  social groups.The author describes stereotypes，prejudice，discrimination based on  those identities，analyses their formation from the cultural，social.political and  historical perspectives and their negative effects on intercultural communication,in  ordder that we can develop our sensitivity to cultural diversity and cultural differences  and find out some practical approaches to effective intercultural communication  1.3.The PractieaI Value of the Thesis\\n    Cultural identity is a controversial issue all around the world.\\n    Cultural diversity has become a fact.Cultural diversity is considered as one of  key phenomena shaping the contemporary world and greatly enhances sensitivity to  cultural identity.Today,in an age when discrete cultures themselves are under threat.the question of cultural identity becomes newly problematic and takes on new urgency.People become more and more concerned about the uniqueness or the particularity of their own culture.National governments that promote multicultural，multiracial harmony like Singapore，or the United States，in fact eahance ethnic separateness by constantly drawing attention tO“racial”,or“ethnic”identities.\\n    Contemporarily or in the long run，to preserve and promote cultural identities  and to discover their traditional value and adaptive function can achieve the harmony  of multicultural or multiethnic societies，and eventual integration and assimilation of cultures，whether on the global level or on the local level.So，the study of cultaral identity in this thesis embodies great practical and historical value.1.4.Methodity\\n    Theoretical and methodological developments of recent decades have transformed anthropology by situating local ethnographic researches within larger systems of power,and by focusing attention on the complex relationships between local communities and larger-scale structures within which these communities are embedded.Studying multi-level，multi-sited research problems is undertaken through the local setting but frames them in terms of global issues and often incorporates ethnographic experience elsewhere.Sociocultural and linguistic anthropologists share a study of many key phenomena and critically analyze and theorize these phenomena through ethnographic investigation of contemporary social, cultural，political，economic，and communicative processes.\\n    This thesis is to study communicative problems based on some cultural identities in intercultural communication.The author develops this study on the basis of sociocultural，anthropological and ethnographic approaches.","extra":"CLC:
